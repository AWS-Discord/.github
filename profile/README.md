### ‚ùì What is the AWS Discord?

The AWS Discord is a community-led server with over 10,000 members and is a place for everyone interested in all things AWS. We have a wide range of channels for discussing AWS, career advice, and exam prep. If you're stuck on a technical problem, we have a dedicated channel for that too! If you're not already a member, you can join us at [discord.gg/aws](https://discord.gg/aws).

If you'd like more info, check out our [Discord server bio](https://discord.com/servers/amazon-web-services-aws-cloud-423842546947457024)!

### üßë‚Äçüíª What's this GitHub Organization for?

We started this organization as a place to collate and share resources for the AWS Discord community. We're hoping to build a library of resources that will help people learn about AWS and prepare for AWS certifications. We're also hoping to build a community of people who are interested in contributing to open source projects.

### üí™ How can I contribute?

If you're interested in helping out, simply reach out in the AWS Discord and we'll get you added into the organization. From there, you'll be able to create repositories and add content. Repositories should contain easily understood content that newcomers to AWS and/or our Discord can use to learn more.
